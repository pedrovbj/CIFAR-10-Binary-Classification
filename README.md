# CIFAR-10 dataset binary classification (ship or not ship) with perceptron 
Image classifier using Perceptron as model for my Embedded Systems course at University of Sao Paulo. It performs binary classification on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, considering "Ship" class as target. The dataset was preprocessed by the professor and each group of students had a target class. There is a C implementation that was later modified and used in Altera DE2-115 board as part of the final project for this course.
